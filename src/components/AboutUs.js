        <h1>About Sri Lankan History</h1>
      <AnimationOnScroll animateIn="animate__fadeInLeftBig">
        <p className="para1">
          The history of Sri Lanka is intertwined with the history of the
          broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions, comprising
          the areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. The
          early human remains found on the island of Sri Lanka date to about
          38,000 years ago (Balangoda Man). The historical period begins roughly
          in the 3rd century, based on Pali chronicles like the Mahavamsa,
          Deepavamsa, and the Culavamsa. They describe the history since the
          arrival of Prince Vijaya from Northern India[1][2][3][4] The earliest
          documents of settlement in the Island are found in these chronicles.
          These chronicles cover the period since the establishment of the
          Kingdom of Tambapanni in the 6th century BCE by the earliest ancestors
          of the Sinhalese. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the Anuradhapura
          Kingdom, Pandukabhaya, is recorded for the 4th century BCE. Buddhism
          was introduced in the 3rd century BCE by Arhath Mahinda (son of the
          Indian emperor Ashoka). The island was divided into numerous kingdoms
          over the following centuries, intermittently (between CE 993–1077)
          united under Chola rule. Sri Lanka was ruled by 181 monarchs from the
          Anuradhapura to Kandy periods.[5][unreliable source?] From the 16th
          century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled by the
          Portuguese, Dutch and British. Between 1597 and 1658, a substantial
          part of the island was under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese lost
          their possessions in Ceylon due to Dutch intervention in the Eighty
          Years' War. Following the Kandyan Wars, the island was united under
          British rule in 1815. Armed uprisings against the British took place
          in 1818 Uva Rebellion and 1848 Matale Rebellion. Independence was
          finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a Dominion of the
          British Empire until 1972. In 1972, Sri Lanka assumed the status of a
          Republic. A constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the
          Executive President the head of state. The Sri Lankan Civil War began
          in 1983, including Insurrections in 1971 and 1987, with the
          25-year-long civil war ending in 2009. There was an attempted coup in
          1962 against the government under Sirimavo Bandaranaike.

          Evidence of human colonization in Sri Lanka appears at the site of
          Balangoda. Balangoda Man arrived on the island about 125,000 years ago
          and has been identified as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who lived in
          caves. Several of these caves, including the well-known Batadombalena
          and the Fa Hien Cave, have yielded many artifacts from these people,
          who are currently the first known inhabitants of the island. Balangoda
          Man probably created Horton Plains, in the central hills, by burning
          the trees in order to catch game. However, the discovery of oats and
          barley on the plains at about 15,000 BCE suggests that agriculture had
          already developed at this early date.[6] Several minute granite tools
          (about 4 centimetres in length), earthenware, remnants of charred
          timber, and clay burial pots date to the Mesolithic. Human remains
          dating to 6000 BCE have been discovered during recent excavations
          around a cave at Warana Raja Maha Vihara and in the Kalatuwawa area.
          Cinnamon is native to Sri Lanka and has been found in Ancient Egypt as
          early as 1500 BCE, suggesting early trade between Egypt and the
          island's inhabitants. It is possible that Biblical Tarshish was
          located on the island. James Emerson Tennent identified Tarshish with
          Galle.[7] The protohistoric Early Iron Age appears to have established
          itself in South India by at least as early as 1200 BCE, if not earlier
          (Possehl 1990; Deraniyagala 1992:734). The earliest manifestation of
          this in Sri Lanka is radiocarbon-dated to c. 1000–800 BCE at
          Anuradhapura and Aligala shelter in Sigiriya (Deraniyagala
          1992:709-29; Karunaratne and Adikari 1994:58; Mogren 1994:39; with the
          Anuradhapura dating corroborated by Coningham 1999). It is very likely
          that further investigations will push back the Sri Lankan lower
          boundary to match that of South India.[8] During the protohistoric
          period (1000-500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern
          India.,[9] and shared the same megalithic burials, pottery, iron
          technology, farming techniques and megalithic graffiti.[10][11] This
          cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans
          such as the Velir, prior to the migration of Prakrit
          speakers.[12][13][10] Archaeological evidence for the beginnings of
          the Iron Age in Sri Lanka is found at Anuradhapura, where a large
          city–settlement was founded before 900 BCE. The settlement was about
          15 hectares in 900 BCE, but by 700 BCE it had expanded to 50
          hectares.[14] A similar site from the same period has also been
          discovered near Aligala in Sigiriya.[15] The hunter-gatherer people
          known as the Wanniyala-Aetto or Veddas, who still live in the central,
          Uva and north-eastern parts of the island, are probably direct
          descendants of the first inhabitants, Balangoda Man. They may have
          migrated to the island from the mainland around the time humans spread
          from Africa to the Indian subcontinent. Later Indo Aryan migrants
          developed a unique hydraulic civilization named Sinhala. Their
          Achievements include the construction of the largest reservoirs and
          dams of the ancient world as well as enormous pyramid-like stupa
          (dāgaba in Sinhala) architecture. This phase of Sri Lankan culture may
          have seen the introduction of early Buddhism.[16] Early history
          recorded in Buddhist scriptures refers to three visits by the Buddha
          to the island to see the Naga Kings, snakes that can take the form of
          a human at will.[17] The earliest surviving chronicles from the
          island, the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa, say that Yakkhas, Nagas,
          Rakkhas and Devas inhabited the island prior to the migration of Indo
          Aryans.
